# Contributing
We are excited that you have chosen to contribute to Accuguide! We want to ensure contributing is a smooth experience both for repository maintainers and contributors, so we have a few guidelines to follow.

1. Ensure your code is clean and well formatted - we use Biome, and once you open a pull request, there will be a status check to check if your code follows the Biome format. It is reccommended to run `bun format` to format your code prior to opening a pull request.
  
2. Make sure your code passes lint checks - this also has a status check on pull requests, but you can manually check with `bun lint`.

3. Make sure all code status checks pass - Let us know if you need help resolving a failed check. Our pull request status checks include tests, formatting, linting, builds, codeql, and Netlify build checks.
   
4. Feel free to reach out to us if you have questions, comments, or concerns! You can reach us via replying to Github issue, opening a Github discussion, or emailing us at dev@accuguide.org.
